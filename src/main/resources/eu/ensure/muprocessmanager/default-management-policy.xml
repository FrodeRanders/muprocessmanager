    <!-- Is it acceptable to fail to compensate? If 'true', compensation will
         continue and if 'false', compensation will be interrupted. Depending
         on whether compensation is done synchronously or asynchronously (by
         the process mManager in the background), the behaviour may differ. -->

    <!-- If the process dies abruptly without synchronously finishing or failing,
         the process may have status PROGRESSING (thus seemingly be progressing).
         The process manager will look for progressing processes that have not
         been touched for a while. This configuration indicates how long this
         time span may be. -->
